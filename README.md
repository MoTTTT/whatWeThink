## Where I only speak for myselves

This is written in first person plural style, for reasons I will explain later. In the meantime, just have fun.

Beauty can be found anywhare. Grow it where you find it.

Take engineering services for example. Elegance can be expressed. I find the following image pleasing to look at for the following reasons:

So that's what we think about most the time. Well, your milage probably varies. The what that we think about, allowing for topic, rendering, diagramming model, requirement, environment, staff, etc. Engineering brief, I suppose.

The rest of the time, the I find life inevitably taking the form of engineering brief. I am sure that is so for any career.

In any case, as ar as writing goes, I have produced much documentation, all technical, and have found the occupation eudaimonic only on occasion. I have tried to categorise the writing I have done, so as to 

If you are familiar with the Waterfall Development Lifecycle, then you will know what

I find myself in the fortunate position of having time to reflect. And have decided to write these refelections, if for no other reason than to refelect on my reflections. As indulgent as that may sound.
